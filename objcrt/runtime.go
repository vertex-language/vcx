// Package objcrt describes the Objective-C runtime ABI: the symbols a
// translation unit defines and references, the sections its metadata is
// placed in, the layout of the structures the runtime walks, and the type
// encodings it reads out of them.
//
// It is data and rules, not emission. Nothing here writes an object file or
// builds IR — lower does that, and it does it by asking this package what
// each thing is called, how big it is, and what goes in it. The split is
// deliberate: the ABI is a contract with a runtime nobody here controls, and
// a contract stated in one place can be read, tested and corrected without
// touching a code generator.
//
// The layouts are the modern (non-fragile) runtime's, which is the only one
// objv emits for. Under it a class's instance variables have no offsets until
// the program loads — the runtime assigns them, through the offset variables
// this package names — which is what lets a framework add an instance
// variable without every program that subclasses it having to be rebuilt.
package objcrt

// Kind is which runtime a target uses.
//
// The two differ in more than a name. Apple's is the one on every Darwin
// platform, and its metadata is what objc4 walks; GNUstep's libobjc2 is what
// Linux and Windows have, and it reads a different set of structures. objv
// emits Apple's today; the GNUstep layouts are named where they differ so
// that adding them is filling in a table rather than finding the seams.
