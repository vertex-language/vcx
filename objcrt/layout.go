// The structures the runtime walks.
//
// Each is described here as a field list with sizes rather than as a Go
// struct, because what lower needs is not a value of the type — it never
// holds one — but the order and width of what it writes. A field list is
// also what can be read against objc4's headers, which is the only way to
// know any of this is right.
//
// Every size below is for a 64-bit target. The runtime's own headers write
// them in terms of pointers and uint32s, and so does this: Size() computes
// from ABI.PtrBytes, and the constants that do not depend on it are stated as
// numbers because they are numbers in the metadata too — a method list's
// entry size is a uint32 field the runtime reads, not something it derives.

// FieldKind is what one field of a metadata structure holds.
