// @available, and what it becomes.
//
// §6.10's `@available(macOS 12.0, *)` asks a question about the machine the
// program is running on, not the one it was built on: an image with a
// deployment target of macOS 11 may be launched on 12, and the check is how
// it finds out. The trailing `*` stands for every platform not named and
// makes the check succeed there, which is what lets one source file carry
// checks for platforms it is not being built for.
//
// It is a compile-time constant whenever the deployment target already
// answers it. A program built for macOS 12 that asks whether it is on macOS
// 12 is asking about something the linker recorded, and clang folds it; so
// does lower.
//
// The runtime call is _availability_version_check, which is libSystem's.
// clang emits __isPlatformVersionAtLeast instead, which is compiler-rt's
// wrapper around this same function with a fallback for systems too old to
// have it — macOS before 10.15. objv links libSystem and not compiler-rt,
// and its Darwin deployment floor is above that fallback's range, so it
// calls the one underneath.

// Platform is the platform field of Mach-O's LC_BUILD_VERSION, which is also
// what _availability_version_check takes. A simulator and a device are
// distinct platforms rather than a flag on one.
