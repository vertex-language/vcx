// What a selector's *name* promises about the object it returns.
//
// ARC has no annotations on the framework methods it calls. What it has is a
// naming convention, and the convention is normative: a method whose selector
// begins with alloc, copy, init, mutableCopy or new returns an object the
// caller owns, and every other method returns one it does not. That is why
// `[[NSString alloc] init]` needs no release in the caller's source and
// `[NSString stringWithFormat:…]` does — and it is why a method called
// `newlineCharacterSet` is not in the family, because the word is "newline"
// and not "new".
//
// The rule is exact, from clang's ARC specification: skip leading
// underscores, take the longest of the five names that the selector starts
// with, and it is a family only if what follows is not a lowercase letter.

// Family is the ownership convention a selector's name implies.
