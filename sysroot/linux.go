// multiarch maps an architecture to Debian's multiarch tuple: the
// directory name under /usr/include where Debian-family distros keep
// the architecture-specific headers (<asm/...> lives there, and glibc
// headers reach it). The tuples are Debian's normalized GNU triplets;
// note armhf, where the hard-float ABI rides the suffix, not the
// vendor field.
//
// Fedora, Arch, and Alpine do not use multiarch. No table entry or
// distro check handles that: the directory does not exist there, and
// an absent directory is an absent entry.
