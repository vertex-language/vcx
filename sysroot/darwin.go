// darwinEntries resolves the macOS SDK. /usr/include does not exist
// on modern macOS; headers live only inside an SDK, found in the
// order the platform's own tools use:
//
//  1. $SDKROOT — set by xcrun and by Xcode-driven builds, so
//     honoring it means vcx composes under both;
//  2. `xcrun --show-sdk-path` — the authoritative answer. Apple owns
//     the developer-directory walk behind it (DEVELOPER_DIR, the
//     xcode-select symlink, the app-path fallbacks) and changes it
//     between releases, so vcx asks rather than reimplements;
//  3. the Command Line Tools SDK at its fixed path, for a machine
//     with the tools installed but xcrun not answering.
//
// /usr/local/include precedes the SDK, matching the platform's
// compilers — it is where Intel-Mac Homebrew installs. Apple-Silicon
// Homebrew's /opt/homebrew is deliberately not probed, also matching
// the platform's compilers: a package manager's prefix is the user's
// to name with -I.
